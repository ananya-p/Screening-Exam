# Software Engineering Screening Exam #

My name is Ananya Pandey and this is my solution to the assignment given to me as the first step of the selection process.
I have uploaded my solutions by the respective names of the questions attempted.

## Attempted Questions ##

**Q2: Given two CSV files with data containing timestamps for each row, merge the two files
using their timestamps as the common key. If the timestamps do not match for a row in a
file then use the last available data. Create an application (command line or GUI based)
to visualize the combined data from the two CSV in real-time playback.**

In the solution, the two .csv files are stored as "Q2 csv1.csv" and "Q2 csv2.csv". The code file is "Q2.py".

**Q3: Design a system to facilitate updating an installed application on 25 computers
connected via intranet (no access to internet). You may use any medium to illustrate
your system design including text based, sketching / charting software or drawn on
paper.**

The design is given in step-by-step form, uploaded as a PDF file.

Thank you.
